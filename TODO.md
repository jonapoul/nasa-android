- Better testing
  - Integrated from VM
  - UI with kaspresso
- zoom/pan buttons on fullscreen images? Or some other way of making it more obvious that you can
- draggable description panel, so you can pull it up from the bottom as a consistent panel, instead of a dialog
- open webpage in browser on APOD website
- open image in browser directly
- switch between grid and linear list view
- display API rate limits somewhere
  - error dialog when it runs out
- daily notifications when APOD is released?
